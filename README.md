# Using AI to detect pain in cats

The project focuses on detecting signs of pain in cats and rating them on the Feline Grimace Scale. This is something normally done by a vet, but I aim to create an Artificial Intelligence that is capable of doing it. I received around 4000 described cat pictures from Vet-AI, a company that specializes in making pet care virtual. Iâ€™m going to use them to build this project. Ideally, the AI would output an accurate pain level rating upon seeing a new picture.
